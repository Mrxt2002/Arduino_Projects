## Getting Started
To get started with these Arduino LED blinking projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
3. Open the Arduino IDE and load the desired project's `.ino` file.
4. Configure the board type and port settings.
5. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
6. Observe the LED blinking pattern as described in the project documentation.

## Projects
Explore the following projects included in this repository:

### 1. Simple LED Blink
This project introduces the basic structure of an Arduino sketch and demonstrates how to make an LED blink at a fixed interval.

### 2. Blinking Patterns
Learn how to create different blinking patterns using multiple LEDs, showcasing various delay intervals and sequences.

### 3. LED Brightness Control
Discover how to control the brightness of an LED using pulse width modulation (PWM) technique, allowing for smooth intensity changes.

## Usage
Each project directory contains the Arduino sketch file (`.ino`) and a wiring diagram (`.jpg` or `.png`). Open the sketch in the Arduino IDE, upload it to your board, and refer to the wiring diagram for proper connections. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different LED configurations.
